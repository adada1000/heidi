                            <hr />
                            <p>I had two fathers, a rich one
                                and a poor one. One was highly educated and intelligent; he
                                had a Ph.D. and completed four years of undergraduate work in less than two years. He
                                then went on to Stanford University, the University of Chicago, and Northwestern
                                University to do his advanced studies, all on full financial scholarships. The other
                                father never finished the eighth grade.</p>
                            <p>Both men were successful in their careers, working hard all their lives. Both earned
                                substantial incomes. Yet one struggled financially all his life. The other would become
                                one of the richest men in Hawaii. One died leaving tens of millions of dollars to his
                                family, charities and his church. The other left bills to be paid.</p>
                            <p>Both men were strong, charismatic and influential. Both men offered me advice, but they
                                did not advise the same things. Both men believed strongly in education but did not
                                recommend the same course of study.</p>
                            <p>If I had had only one dad, I would have had to accept or reject his advice. Having two
                                dads advising me offered me the choice of contrasting points of view; one of a rich man
                                and one of a poor man.</p>
                            <p>Instead of simply accepting or rejecting one or the other, I found myself thinking more,
                                comparing and then choosing for myself.</p>
                            <p>The problem was, the rich man was not rich yet and the poor man not yet poor. Both were
                                just starting out on their careers, and both were struggling with money and families.
                                But they had very different points of view about the subject of money.</p>
                            <p>For example, one dad would say, "The love of money is the root of all evil." The other,
                                "The lack of money is the root of all evil."</p>
                            <p>As a young boy, having two strong fathers both influencing me was difficult. I wanted to
                                be a good son and listen, but the two fathers did not say the same things. The contrast
                                in their points of view, particularly where money was concerned, was so extreme that I
                                grew curious and intrigued. I began to start thinking for long periods of time about
                                what each was saying.</p>
